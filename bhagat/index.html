          <br />[a] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary[6]
          who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police
          officer[7] in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian
          nationalist.[8] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of
          the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail,
          which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned
          newspapers—turned him into a household name in Punjab region, and
          after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern
          India.

              the Assembly chamber from its public gallery. Their intention was

              young men began shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long
              Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. Then they offered

              Conspiracy Case. Hanged in the Lahore jail. Bhagat Singh was just
              23 years old. The bodies were then secretly cremated outside Ganda
              Singh Wala village.
